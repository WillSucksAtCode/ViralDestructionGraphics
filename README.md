Elevator Pitch subtitles: Hello there, my name is william and I am going to be doing this project solo. Iâ€™ll be working on my GDW game for this project: Viral Destruction. Viral Destruction game is an FPS wave shooter about an FBI agent going into an infected government facility to rescue any survivors there may be. They'll have to fight against waves of the infected as they make their way lower and lower into the facility as they aim to stop the infection. Given that most of our game will be inside of a relatively close quarters facility, I want to use multiple different tools to make our game look great, mainly I plan to add Normal mapping to give our building more depth, a Toon Ramp for more distinct shading, culling for better resource management, particles and shadows for more visual flair. Basically, over the duration of this course I want to practice with shaders and other visual techniques to make this game look great
